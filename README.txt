FASTAPI used for who knows what

Vagrant folder has files for: Jenkins VM, and a K8s cluster consisting of 3 nodes, that will be connected between them

Jenkins config needs to be done and add 2 tokens:

 --> git token for private repo
 --> docker token for private image repo

Pipeline is severly lacking, but at the moment will suffice :)
